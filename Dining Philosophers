The Dining Philosophers Problem
- Idea:
    Five silent philosophers (no inter-thread communication) sit at a round table 
    with a bowl of spaghetti.
    Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers (also 5 forks).

    Each philosopher must alternatively think and eat.
    Can only eat when having both left and right forks. Each folk can be held by 
    only one philosopher.
    Can only pick up a folk one by one.
    After a philosopher finishes eating, put down the forks (available to others).

- Problem:
    + Deadlock:
    All philosophers pick up their right forks at the same time. All of them 
    will eternally wait for each other to release the folk.

    + Resource Starvation:
    Occur when a philosopher is unable to acquire both forks due to timing problem.

- Solution:
    + Resource  Hierarchy
    Number the resource from 1 to 5, and each philosopher will always pick up 
    the lower-numbered fork first then the higher-numbered fork.
